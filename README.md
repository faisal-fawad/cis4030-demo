## Documentation
### Quick Overview
> **NOTE:** This application was built on top of boilerplate code generated by `flutter create`
- [`/lib/main.dart`](./lib/main.dart) contains most of the code, see the file for more detailed documentation. The way it stores data is briefly described below:
  - It uses `hive` boxes to maintain the state of generated groups
  - It uses `shared_preferences` to maintain the type of view displayed to the user
- [`/lib/mock_data.dart`](./lib/mock_data.dart) contains mock data for names and lessons
- [`pubspec.yaml`](./pubspec.yaml) contains our dependencies, which was modified to support `hive` and `shared_preferences`

### Official
- `hive`: [GitHub](https://github.com/isar/hive) or [compiled docs](https://hivedb.dev/#/)
- [`shared_preferences`](https://pub.dev/documentation/shared_preferences/latest/)
  - [Plugin](https://pub.dev/documentation/shared_preferences/latest/)
- [Flutter](https://api.flutter.dev/)
